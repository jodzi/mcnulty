# Project McNulty

####Client:  
A bank - Bank of Shire

####Client's question/need:  
We are having a campaign.  We are trying to get people to subscribe to a term deposit.  We have been recording our success rate on clients for a while.  Can you tell us who we can convert based on their financial data?

####Description of the data:
We have the clients age, job, employees, types of loans, if they have any credit defaults, when we called them, their education, and also whether the call was successful or not.  What can we learn?
